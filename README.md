# Ask-The-Community
This is an initiative where-in people can ask questions (directly or anonymously) as issues. People can then respond to them as comments. Once there is a satisfactory answer, we can close that issue down.
If you wish to ask the questions anonymously, use the form (https://goo.gl/forms/8KI1uMZely2UyFIf2) and we will create an issue here after validating the question. Else, if you wish to ask directly, feel free to create an issue here on your own. :)
